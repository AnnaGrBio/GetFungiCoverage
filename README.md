Scripts used in manuscript entitled: "The emergence of proto-genes: a large-scale investigation of
the mutations enabling the formation of de novo genes"

Scripts starting with "Part1" are used to extract proto-genes, 
from Pg1 to Pg12, scripts starting with "Part2" are used to find orthology between proto-genes, 
detect and study non-coding homologs, from Pg1 to Pg12,
and scripts starting with "Part3" are used for data analyse, as well as the 4 R scripts.
